# C-Shape Box Animation App (Flutter)

This Flutter app dynamically renders a series of red boxes in the shape of the letter **‘C’**, based on user input. Users can tap on boxes to turn them green, and once all are green, an automatic reverse animation turns them back to red — in the order they were tapped.
